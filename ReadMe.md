# Shrutajnana
Shrutajnana (version:1, patch:0, draft:0)

## About
`Shrutajnana` is a term used in Jainism for complete knowledge of Jain Agamas.

This repository has been named `Shrutajnana`, analogous to the fact that I'm trying to learn Data Structures and Algorithms.

And DSA are bases of everything in Computer Science.

## Contributing
