Given an integer `x`, return true if `x` is palindrome integer.

An integer is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward.

- For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

Example 1:
```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
````
Example 3:
```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
````

Constraints:

- `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`
